## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze employee data and identify the main causes of **attrition and performance gaps**.  
By leveraging data analytics, the goal is to provide actionable insights that help organizations:  
- Reduce employee turnover  
- Improve job satisfaction

## 🔎 Overview

This project represents an end-to-end HR analytics workflow using **Microsoft Power BI** — including data cleaning, transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.  
The resulting dashboard empowers HR managers to **visualize attrition trends**, track **key KPIs**, and make **informed workforce decisions** based on real data rather than assumptions.

## 🛑 Problem Statement

The HR department lacked a clear understanding of attrition patterns and workforce distribution.  
Key challenges identified were:

* No unified view of **attrition rate**, **demographics**, or **department performance**.  
* Difficulty determining **why and when** employees leave.  
* Limited visibility into **salary-based** or **tenure-based** retention trends.  
* No consolidated analytics to support **HR policy decisions**.  

This dashboard provides clarity by bringing all workforce metrics together in a single, interactive Power BI interface.
